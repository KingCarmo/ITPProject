      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h2>Cocktail Dreams</h2>
      <p><b>Cocktail Dreams was founded in 1874 by all of our grandparents. The name "Cocktail Dreams" came about after Kevins great-great-great-great Grandfather, Kevin Sr-Sr-Sr-Sr.<br>
        found a place with the same name in Greece. He saw a way of moulding it in to what we have today. Kevin Sr-Sr-Sr-Sr employed 4 more people, Ailis Sr-Sr-Sr-Sr, Kaitlyn Sr-Sr-Sr-Sr,<br>
         Aidan Sr-Sr-Sr-Sr and the notorious, infamous, handsome....Clive. He's Peter's great-great-great-great grandfather. His family doesn't do names like the rest. Clive's ideas differed</br>
         from the rest, he felt that Cocktail Dreams should only produce Irish pure alcohol. The rest disagreed. They felt that all alcohol should be accepted. Even if the alcohol comes from<br>
         non-alcoholic backgrounds. Clive called these alcohols 'MudFloods'. So he built a chamber without the knowledge of the other Founders. In it, he hid a load of Pure Alcohols and a<br>
         massive snake. His heir, Peter, is now able to open the chamber and relsease the huge snake to drink all the MudFloods and this is just the plot to Harry Potter and the Chamber<br>
         of Secrets. In reality, this website was founded in 2017 as a college project. Kev does the work, Ailis and Kaitlyn do girly things like talk and laugh a lot, Aidan doesn't show up<br>
         and Peter just stands there and looks fucking gooood.</b></p>
